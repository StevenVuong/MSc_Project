Main Files: p1, p2 and p3. <br>
-  p1 is the pre-preprocessing of the dataframe (checking which files are valid to use for classification, avoiding error etc..)
-  p2 is the pre-processing of images (augments, and loads images into multi-dimensional array with their classes)
-  p3 is the deep learning model
-  p4 is our metrics and analysis. We store our metrics and our models in g-drive
